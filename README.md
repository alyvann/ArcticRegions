# ArcticRegions

“Tracing The Arctic Regions” is a digital humanities project that considers a historic "art expedition to Greenland" in the summer of 1869, the 140 photographs that document it, and how they shaped nineteenth-century America's understanding of Arctic space and time. Developed at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA), the project grew out of Dr. George Philip LeBourdais' dissertation in the Department of Art & Art History at Stanford University.
