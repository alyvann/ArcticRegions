<h1>Trapped: Seventy-five Degrees North</h1>

The polar bear hunt resonates as point of high drama in The Arctic Regions. It also served an essential role for the expedition’s narrative. By depicting a struggle for life and death, the episode set the stage for the apex of the expedition and the mortal realities of life in the Arctic. While the ship Panther had crossed the Arctic Circle at 66° N latitude weeks before, Bradford and his crew wanted to press on. In an era fixated on superlatives and one-upmanship, reaching the farthest point possible would have been both a thrill for members of the expedition. It would be a way of accruing prestige to their accomplishments and assuring bragging rights back home.

In this sense, the journey of the Panther was another precedent for expeditions to come. Although Rear Admiral Robert Peary became famous for his race against Frederick Cook in 1908 to reach the North Pole (though evidence suggests that neither did), he was already celebrated in 1902 for having reached first Greenland’s highest latitude. He then went a stretch further, to the edge of Ellsmere Island, Canada’s most northern point. Efforts like these fulfilled both a sense of national accomplishment and new measurements of masculinity. With each new record, Arctic explorers of the age made claims not only for their homelands but also for their own intrepidity.

By reaching Melville Bay in 1869, the crew of the Panther notched an impressive if qualified achievement. Entering the pack ice at 75° N placed them, by Bradford’s estimation, “much further, certainly, than anyone had ever before ventured for the purposes of art, and quite as far as it was safe to go unless prepared to winter in the ice, which we were not.” The statement acknowledges explorers who had previously reached higher latitudes, most notably Elisha Kent Kane, whose celebrated exploits on the Grinnell Expeditions in the 1850s had brought him to 80° N in Kennedy Channel. And in 1871, before the photographs from Bradford’s 1869 expedition were published in The Arctic Regions, another American, Charles Francis Hall, died of mysterious circumstances before his crew was trapped in the ice of Smith Sound. When published on the front page of the New York Times on July 20, 1873, the report on this fatal expedition underscored the fragility of human life in the Arctic environment.

In paying deference to higher latitude heroes, however, Bradford was also staking his claim as America’s preeminent artist. Going “further than anyone ever had for the purposes of art” rings as a not-so-subtle shot at Frederic Edwin Church, the preeminent landscape painter in the United States at the time. In 1861, Church had caused a stir with the exhibition of his painting Icebergs: The North, the result of his own expedition to Labrador in 1859. This trip, floridly chronicled by Louis Legrand Noble in his book After Icebergs with a Painter, further cemented Church as one of America’s great artist-explorers. He was willing to go to great lengths, in the words of one prominent critic, “to make this canvas reflect the glint and gloom, the grandeur and beauty, the coldness and desolation of the north…” While Bradford might have accepted that his own paintings of first-hand Arctic experience would remain the shadow of Church’s extraordinary talent, his writing in The Arctic Regions positions this expedition as a more dangerous and thus more impressive enterprise. It must have been deeply gratifying to Bradford when Church later purchased negatives from the former’s 1869 expedition as tools of study.
