<h1>“Homeward Bound”: Protocols of Truth</h1>

<p>
As the weather cooled in the last days of September 1869, the <i>Panther</i> and its crew began their journey home. After three months, five thousand miles and numerous notes, sketches and photographs, Bradford now faced the task of crafting summary thoughts on his groundbreaking expedition. Those reflections, and the pictures that accompany them, generate an intriguing twist to final judgments about the issues of photographic truth and geographic accuracy that define <i>The Arctic Regions</i>.
</p>

<p>
The final chapter forms a microcosm of the book’s rhetorical structure. The text moves from empirical observations of the landscape to fulsome descriptions of it. For instance, after noting the height of mountain climbed just before their final departure, Bradford effused on “the beautiful effects of light and shade as the sunlight played on the multi-formed and parti-colored rocks, relieved by the glistening of the icebergs that frequently intervened” between the ship and Disco Island. In this book, everything ends with a flourish.<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Bradford, The Arctic Regions, 86.">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
This tension between objective and subjective records provides a useful framework for understanding the penultimate photograph of the book. Titled “Homeward Bound,” the image conveys a calming sense of resolution following the final sentence of the volume. The view looks out from the low, dark rock that forms the shore towards the horizon of a tranquil sea.
</p>

<p>
Yet the meaning of the image depends largely on which particular copy of the book the reader has just finished, because the photographs in some versions have been altered. In some surviving copies of <i>The Arctic Regions</i>, the shaded slabs of some icebergs appear on the distant horizon at the center of the print. When paired with the caption “Homeward Bound,” the picture seems to claim that one final view was made on land before the photographers boarded the ship and set off for Newfoundland. A parting shot, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
Other versions of the book, however, contradict this narrative. In those copies, a tiny ship appears in front of the central icebergs, with smoke spiraling away from its spindly masts. Close inspection suggests that this ship was either added directly to the negative by hand, or drawn on a print which was itself photographed and then reprinted.

<p>
These alterations tangibly change the meaning of the image and by extension the book’s conclusion. Adding the ship reads as a more literal illustration of the phrase “Homeward Bound”; we can now see the ship as it sailed for home. But tying the story up so nicely also complicates things. Are we to pretend the photographers remained behind to document the departure, as the position of the camera implies? Or is it more nuanced, encouraging viewers to stand in the shoes of the Danish and Inuit friends as they watch the <i>Panther</i> sail into the distance? Whatever the intention, the alteration has the unintended consequence of making one question the truth value of the photograph, and by extension the credibility of the images writ large.
</p>

<p>
Embellishing the photographs like this was a risky move for an artist whose reputation was built on their perceived truthfulness. <i>The London Art Journal</i>, for instance, esteemed that “Mr. Bradford’s are the only works which profess incontrovertible truth in the representation of the northern regions.”<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Art Journal (London) 12 (1873): 255.">[1]</a> In turn, the public believed that paintings like Sermitsialik Glacier (discussed above in the essay <i>Sermitsialik: The Challenges of Scale</i>) were truthful because they copied the composition of specific photographs in <i>The Arctic Regions</i>. Yet, as demonstrated by these conspicuous changes to the prints--the additions of ships to the horizon or polar bears to the empty pack ice--Bradford and his collaborators implied that doctoring “true” photographs made them, perversely, more believable. What explains this willingness to undermine the truth value of their photographs?
</p>

<p>
On this front, there are no easy answers. There is little documentation of the collaboration between Bradford and staff at Samson and Low, the London-publishing house that printed <i>The Arctic Regions</i>, and nothing that acknowledges the altered photographs. The same is true of James Wallace Black’s photography studio in Boston, where the negatives from the expedition were printed and then shipped to England where they were pasted into each copy of the book. Thus, regarding the artistic intent of altering negatives, there is no smoking gun.

In his essay titled “The Not So Truthful Lens,” Adam Greenhalgh presents a meticulous account of other altered prints in The Arctic Regions to argue that Bradford made what amounts to “a symbolic portrait of a mythical Arctic that had captured the public imagination during the second half of the nineteenth century.”<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Adam Greenhalgh, “The Not So Truthful Lens: William Bradford’s ‘The Arctic Regions,’” In William Bradford: Sailing Ships and Arctic Seas, Richard C. Kugler ed., (Seattle; London: New Bedford Whaling Museum; University of Washington Press, 2003), 72–86.">[1]</a> Greenhalgh makes a compelling case that “Bradford’s overall project can be thought of as an attempt to compensate for the limitations he perceived to be inherent to the camera.” Indeed, painters of Bradford’s day often considered photographs crude translations of reality, and that only the interpretive verve of a painter reached the level of “art.” This credible argument has helped to reconcile this historical tension between painting and photography.
