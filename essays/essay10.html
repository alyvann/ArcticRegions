<h1>“Homeward Bound”</h1>

<p>
Alterations Bradford made to the book’s penultimate image offer visual corollaries of this equation of ice with motion.
    While variations to position, cropping and even the images themselves might be expected through the many hand-printed
    photographs in various copies of The Arctic Regions, the meaning of these variations have not been explored.
    Titled “Homeward Bound,” the photograph depicts the end of Bradford’s expedition as the Panther returned down the
    Greenland coast in September, 1869. Some copies feature an iceberg in the distant horizon at the center of the print.
    In its place in other versions, the spindly masts of a tiny black ship have been scratched onto the surface as a
    small draft of smoke circles tightly to the right.

The transposition implies more than just a compositional convenience. Rather, it seems that the iceberg, a flashing carte
    blanche on the horizon, becomes a kind of canvas within a photograph, allowing the artist to project the flow of his
    thoughts onto white space. If icebergs moved constantly by the material flows of the Arctic environment, why should
    they not also be moved by creative agency, allowing another mobile object to take their place? For what is an artist,
    if not one who accomplishes a paradox like moving reality while holding it still?

Consider that the first image variant with the iceberg – which, we must recall, is a photograph taken from the shore –
    makes “Homeward Bound” an ambiguous title. Is this the last image taken from the coast of Greenland before the Panther headed for home? Is it the iceberg itself, now dissolving back into the great water cycle of which it was part and particle? Or is it even the view of those still standing on land – Inuit, Polar Bear, a sentient glacier – that now watches the ship disappear on its tack back to more southern climes? This ambiguity cuts the viewer loose from terra firma, making one question the truth value of the photograph, and promoting a vision of the Arctic that is contingent and ever-changing, a trace of a place at a single moment in time.
