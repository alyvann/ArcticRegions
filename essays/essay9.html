<h1>Upernavik, Godhavn, Jacobshavn: On Glaciers and Vanishing</h1>


<p>
	As the <i>Panther</i>began its return trip south, the crew visited a number of western Greenland’s northern settlements. This section of <i>The Arctic Regions</i> striking due to the number of photographs, most of them portraits of local families, that it contains. Indeed, this fourteenth chapter includes 16 photographs, the second highest density of images in the book. Yet these images send a conflicted meaning. While they commemorate the existence of certain people, in sum the photographs perform a kind of salvage ethnography, suggesting that human life in the Arctic was doomed to vanish.

</p>

<p>
Around August 20, the <i>Panther</i> returned to Upernavik, the northernmost settlement in Greenland, and one of the highest points of year-round human habitation in the world. There, the crew enjoyed an unexpected reunion: they met Peter Jansen, a dog-sled driver and interpreter, and Dr. Rudolph, the Danish Governor of Northern Greenland who had both helped Isaac Hayes during his expedition in 1860.

This happy encounter, however, also framed more dire reflections on the people who lived at these rarified latitudes. When Rudolph pointed out flowers that had grown from seeds planted by a Christian missionary several years earlier, Bradford saw a metaphor for the beneficent growth of Christianity to the far reaches of the world. As a Quaker, he may also have seen it as an Arctic parallel to then-President Ulysses S. Grant’s Indian “Peace Policy” instituted in the spring of 1869. It tasked Quakers with “assimilating” the Pawnee, Oto, and Omaha tribes of Nebraska.
</p>

<p>
This social policy informed a larger cultural belief among Anglo-Americans that indigenous peoples were ill-equipped for the modern world and thus doomed to fade into history. Known as the “Vanishing Race” trope, the idea became more explicit when the expedition arrived in Jacobshavn as it continued south.
</p>

<p>
A Danish settlement around 70 degrees north, Jacobshavn is now known as Ilulissat, the Kalaallisut word for “icebergs.” It was the 8th of September, and cold winds had begun to stiffen the air. The narrative takes on a bleak finality as the crew packed up to leave and begin the final leg of the journey back to Newfoundland.
</p>

<p>
Glaciers around the settlement had begun to advance, pinching the already narrow ribbon of land between ice and sea. This encroaching threat had already wiped out several smaller settlements nearby. “The climate has sensibly changed,” Bradford wrote, “within the memory of people now living, and as the great Mer de Glace, in its constant progress towards the sea overwhelms the land and fills up the fjords, it is probable that many of the present out-stations will be abandoned, and as the centuries roll along, all that we now know of Greenland will be a thing of the past.” “These facts account for the difference between Greenland past and Greenland present,” Bradford concluded, imagining the landscape being laid waste by an “annually-increasing sea of ice.”<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Bradford, The Arctic Regions, 88.">[1]</a>

The Chicago Tribune published a similar observation sent by Isaac Hayes. He noted that Norse chronicles made “very little mention made of ice as a disturbing element in navigation,” as it was for their 1869 expedition. “In many places in this awful country the valleys are so filled [with snow and ice] that they have become level with the summits of the mountains, and there is a desert waste of whiteness, smooth as the sea, and void of life as Sahara.”<a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="Isaac I. Hayes, “GREENLAND: Its Glaciers and Decreasing Temperature,” Chicago Tribune (1860-1872); Chicago, Ill., July 13, 1872, 5.">[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
These observations correspond to what scientists have identified as a “Little Ice Age,” a prolonged period of colder temperatures from around 1300 to 1850 that caused rivers to freeze and glaciers to advance across northern Europe.<a href="#note3" id="ref3" title="See Brian M. Fagan, The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History, 1300-1850 (New York: Basic Books, 2000).
">[3]</a> Bradford could not have known that this period of global cooling was at an end, but he did see the sweeping environmental change as a threat to the Inuit civilization he was documenting. In this light, the sum of Inuit photographs in the The Arctic Regions anticipate the tone of salvage ethnography, the practice of collecting stories and images of cultures on the brink of extinction.

This episode, perhaps more than any other in the book, shows how far our current perceptions are from those commonly held in the nineteenth-century.
