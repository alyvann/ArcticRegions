<h1>Returning South, Warm Receptions</h1>

<p>
Beginning south under the endless sun of late August, the Panther arrived in the port of Upernavik. It was the northernmost settlement in Greenland, and one of the highest points of year-round human habitation in the world.

Although Bradford was in these rarefied latitudes for the first time, they were familiar to one of the crew’s invited members, Dr. Isaac Israel Hayes. A veteran of several high-profile expeditions, including the harrowing 1853-55 Second Grinnell Expedition in search of John Franklin and his own, privately funded trip in 1860, Hayes had become America’s most accomplished Arctic explorer by 1869. In fact, Hayes had been instrumental in helping Bradford select the Panther as the expedition’s vessel and in securing John Bartlett as its captain.

Returning to Upernavik after nearly being nipped in the ice, Hayes enjoyed an unexpected reunion. Peter Jansen, a dog-sled driver and interpreter, and Dr. Rudolph, the Danish Governor of Northern Greenland who had both helped Hayes in his last push towards Smith Sound in 1860, were there to receive the Panther and its crew. Rudolph apparently took special pleasure in pointing out flowers that had grown from seeds planted by a missionary several years earlier. As a devout Quaker himself, Bradford took their invasive blossoming as a metaphor for the beneficent growth of Christianity to the far reaches of the world.

But Upernavik also symbolized America’s spread into the Arctic in other ways. Though he was there to advise Bradford as he created material for The Arctic Regions, reaching this high latitude caused Hayes to reminisce on his own book, published in 1867, The Open Polar Sea: Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery Towards the North Pole, in the Schooner “United States.”

The concept of an open Polar was at the heart of the ongoing search for the Northwest Passage. Providing a direct route from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, the passage . Hayes had been present in 1855 when Elisha Kent Kane claimed to have glimpsed this ocean, teeming with life, promising more welcoming waters to future explorers. His text represented the most comprehensive argument for the existence of this improbable open sea beyond the thickest ice.
