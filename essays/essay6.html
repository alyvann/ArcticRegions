<h1>Karsut Fjord: Traces of Deep Time</h1>


<p>
One of Bradford’s abiding interests in <i>The Arctic Regions</i> was describing Arctic geology in terms his audience could grasp. Yet there was little to which an American in the 1870s might compare the awesome Karsut Fjord, a 120-mile gash in the rough feldspar of Greenland’s western edge. In an 1885 lecture for the American Geographical Society in New York, the artist attempted to transpose Greenland’s landscape into an American key.

“Every American, at least every North American,” he began, “is familiar with winter scenery, wastes of snow, frozen rivers and lakes, but in our temperate times winter does not again the awful grandeur of the polar regions, in which ice mountains and frozen torrents are perennial and the solitudes immense, unbroken, awful.” He even imagined that this scenery actively worked against the mind’s ability to process it, claiming “thought itself is arrested in the presence of a nature of such sublimity.”<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="William Bradford, “Life and Scenery in the Far North,” Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York 17 (January 1, 1885): 79.">[1]</a>

Points of comparison soon entered his mind as he and the ship sailed up the fjord, known today by its Inuit name Kangerlussuaq. Bradford described this rock from the Archean basement of the earth, igneous stuff forged four billion years ago, by relating it, perhaps unexpectedly, to a well-known part of his homeland. “[T]he high, precipitous, naked rocks” of Karsut Fjord appeared to him “an Arctic Yosemite.” In other words, he wanted the audience to view a remote glacial landscape through the prism of life and scenery in the United States. Exaggerating, he claimed the precipitous, 3,000 foot tall walls of stone made Karsut “almost an exact reproduction in outline” of the fabled California valley.<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="William Bradford, “Life and Scenery in the Far North,” Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York 17 (January 1, 1885): 106.">[1]</a>

Having lived in San Francisco for several years after this 1869 trip to Greenland, Bradford had become quite familiar with Yosemite. The artist made multiple trips to the valley in order to sketch the scenery firsthand. The artist must also have admired the photographs of Yosemite taken by Bay Area photographer Carleton Watkins in the early 1860s. Renowned for their clarity, Watkins’ 18-by-22 inch “mammoth-plate” prints proved that Bradford could bring similar sized cameras on his art expedition.

Similarities between Karsut Fjord and Yosemite Valley were particularly germane to theories of glaciation, hotly debated in those years. In the early 1870s, the prominent Scottish-born naturalist John Muir was locked in a public and very personal disagreement with California state geologist Josiah Dwight Whitney. Muir believed that glaciers had carved the U-shaped Yosemite Valley, great rivers of ancient ice that had since retreated. Whitney disagreed. He was convinced (wrongly) that parts of the mountains had dropped down to create the valley, calling the untrained Muir “an ignoramus sheep herder” to drive home his point. Scientists now side with the sheep herder.

<p>
Yet while others litigated geological theories, Bradford was making a broader ideological argument about America, its citizens, and their deep connection to the land. By relating the epic Arctic landscape to the United States, he connected the American people to nearly half of the northern hemisphere. If historic glaciers formed a bridge between Greenland and America, then perhaps U.S. citizens—rather than their European counterparts—were destined to explore, mine, and paint the Arctic environment. Understanding a landscape and its history thus intensified connections with both the place one was from and the places one visited.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the connection between Karsut Fjord and Yosemite Valley also savored of colonialism. As other episodes in <i>The Arctic Regions</i> showed, white American narratives often erased histories of Greenland’s indigenous peoples. But the urge to make sense of the distant Arctic by way of an iconic American landscape remains a revealing feature of Bradford’s reflections on the merits and meaning of his Arctic expedition.
