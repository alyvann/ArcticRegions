<h1>Traces of Deep Time: Karsut Fjord</h1>

<p>
One of Bradford’s great challenges in The Arctic Regions was to describe the strange and impressive landscape of Greenland in terms his audience could grasp. Yet there was little to which an American in the 1870s might compare the awesome Karsut Fjord. In an 1885 lecture for the American Geographical Society in New York, the artist reflected on the difficulty of this kind of translation.

“Every American, at least every North American,” he began, “is familiar with winter scenery, wastes of snow, frozen rivers and lakes, but in our temperate times winter does not again the awful grandeur of the polar regions, in which ice mountains and frozen torrents are perennial and the solitudes immense, unbroken, awful.” He even imagined that this scenery actively worked against the mind’s ability to process it, claiming “thought itself is arrested in the presence of a nature of such sublimity.”

Points of comparison soon entered his mind as he and the ship sailed up the fjord, known today by its Inuit name Kangerlussuaq, a 120-mile gash in the rough feldspar of Greenland’s western edge. Bradford described this rock from the Archean basement of the earth, igneous stuff forged four billion years ago, by relating it, perhaps unexpectedly, to a well-known part of his homeland. “[T]he high, precipitous, naked rocks” of Karsut Fjord appeared to him “an Artic Yosemite.” In other words, he wanted the audience to view a remote glacial landscape through the prism of life and scenery in the United States. Exaggerating, he claimed the precipitous, 3,000 foot tall walls of stone made Karsut “almost an exact reproduction in outline” of the fabled valley in California.

Having lived in San Francisco for several years after this 1869 trip to Greenland, Bradford became quite familiar with Yosemite himself. As landscape photography had become an essential tool for his studio paintings, the artist must have admired the photographs of Yosemite taken by Carleton Watkins in the early 1860s. [fig.] Renowned for their clarity, Watkins’ 18-by-22 inch “mammoth-plate” prints may have inspired Bradford to bring similar sized cameras on his art expedition. Bradford even traveled to the valley himself in order to soak in and sketch the scenery firsthand.

The similarities of shape and texture shared by Arctic and American rocks also seemed to back up theories about the geological force of glaciers that were hotly debated in the early 1870s. In these years, the prominent Scottish-born naturalist John Muir was locked in a public and very personal debate with the California state geologist Josiah Dwight Whitney. Muir believed the valley was carved by ancient glaciers—essentially, great rivers of ice that accounted for its U-shape—that had since retreated. Whitney disagreed. He was convinced, wrongly, that parts of the mountains had dropped down to create the valley, calling the untrained Muir “an ignoramus sheep herder” to drive home his point. Scientists now side with the sheep herder.

Yet while others argued for one geological theory over another, Bradford was making a broader  ideological argument about America, its citizens, and their connection to historical time. By relating the epic Arctic landscape to America, he connected American people to a profound past in which the earth as they knew it was formed. If glaciers had formed both Greenland and America, then perhaps Americans were well-equipped—better even than their European counterparts—to explore, mine, and paint the Arctic environment. Understanding the landscape and its age thus seemed to intensify the artist’s connection to the place he visited, and simultaneously to the place he was from.

Of course, this connection between Karsut Fjord and Yosemite Valley only went so far. As we have seen from previous photographs, long histories Kalaallit Inuit peoples in Greenland were often ignored by white visitors. But the urge to make sense of the distant Arctic through an iconic American landscape remains a distinct and compelling feature of Bradford’s later reflections on The Arctic Regions and the expedition it recorded.
