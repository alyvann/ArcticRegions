<h1>Seventy-five Degrees North: Finding the Edge</h1>

<p>
The polar bear hunt stands as a point of high drama in <i>The Arctic Regions</i>. It also served an essential role in the expedition’s narrative. By depicting a struggle for life and death, the episode set the stage for the apex of the expedition and the mortal threats of the uppermost Arctic. While the ship Panther had crossed the Arctic Circle at 66° N latitude weeks before, Bradford and his crew wanted to press on. In an era fixated on superlatives and firsts, reaching the farthest point possible would have been a thrill for members of the expedition and an accomplishment they could parlay into future opportunities. But according to the self-realization parables at the heart of Arctic narratives, reaching the highest point wasn’t just a means to an end; it had become an end in itself.

By reaching Melville Bay in 1869, the crew of the Panther notched an impressive if qualified achievement. Entering the pack ice at 75° N placed them, by Bradford’s estimation, “much further, certainly, than anyone had ever before ventured for the purposes of art, and quite as far as it was safe to go unless prepared to winter in the ice, which we were not.”<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Bradford, The Arctic Regions, 74.">[1]</a>

The statement acknowledges explorers who had previously reached higher latitudes. In the 1850s, Elisha Kent Kane became one of America’s first national celebrities thanks to the books that chronicled his experiences on the Grinnell Expeditions to find Sir John Franklin, journeys that brought him to 80ºN in the Kennedy Channel. In 1871, before the photographs from Bradford’s 1869 expedition were printed for The Arctic Regions, the American explorer Charles Francis Hall died of mysterious circumstances before his crew was trapped in the ice of Smith Sound, the channel separating Greenland from Canada around 78º N. A <i>New York Times</i> story on the tragedy from  <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1873/05/11/82024451.html?pageNumber=4" target="_blank">July 20, 1873</a> cast doubt on the merit of Arctic exploration: “Whether it is worth while to risk the lives of brave men in following what may be but a fleeting mirage, is a question which the death of Capt. Hall and the sufferings of his gallant companions will incline most people to answer in the negative.”

In paying deference to higher latitude heroes, however, Bradford was also staking his claim as America’s preeminent artist. Going “further than anyone ever had for the purposes of art” rings as a not-so-subtle shot at Frederic Edwin Church, the preeminent landscape painter in the United States at the time. In 1861, Church had caused a stir with the exhibition of his painting Icebergs: The North, the result of his own expedition to Labrador in 1859. This trip, floridly chronicled by Louis Legrand Noble in his book After Icebergs with a Painter, further cemented Church as one of America’s great artist-explorers. He was willing to go to great lengths, in the words of one prominent critic, “to make this canvas reflect the glint and gloom, the grandeur and beauty, the coldness and desolation of the north…” While Bradford might have accepted that his own paintings of first-hand Arctic experience would remain the shadow of Church’s extraordinary talent, his writing in The Arctic Regions positions this expedition as a more dangerous and thus more impressive enterprise. It must have been deeply gratifying to Bradford when Church later purchased negatives from the former’s 1869 expedition as tools of study.
