<h1>Seventy-five Degrees North: Finding the Edge</h1>

<p>
The polar bear hunt stands as a point of high drama in <i>The Arctic Regions</i>. It also served an essential role in the expedition’s narrative. By depicting a struggle for life and death, the episode set the stage for the apex of the expedition and the mortal threats of the uppermost Arctic. While the ship Panther had crossed the Arctic Circle at 66° N latitude weeks before, Bradford and his crew wanted to press on. In an era fixated on superlatives and firsts, reaching the farthest point possible would have been a thrill for members of the expedition and an accomplishment they could parlay into future opportunities. But according to the self-realization parables at the heart of Arctic narratives, reaching the highest point wasn’t just a means to an end; it had become an end in itself.

By reaching Melville Bay in 1869, the crew of the Panther notched an impressive if qualified achievement. Entering the pack ice at 75° N placed them, by Bradford’s estimation, “much further, certainly, than anyone had ever before ventured for the purposes of art, and quite as far as it was safe to go unless prepared to winter in the ice, which we were not.”<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Bradford, The Arctic Regions, 74.">[1]</a>

The statement acknowledges explorers who had previously reached higher latitudes. In the 1850s, Elisha Kent Kane became one of America’s first national celebrities thanks to the books that chronicled his experiences on the Grinnell Expeditions to find Sir John Franklin, journeys that brought him to 80ºN in the Kennedy Channel. In 1871, before the photographs from Bradford’s 1869 expedition were printed for The Arctic Regions, the American explorer Charles Francis Hall died of mysterious circumstances before his crew was trapped in the ice of Smith Sound, the channel separating Greenland from Canada around 78º N. <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1873/05/11/82024451.html?pageNumber=4" target="_blank"> A <i>New York Times </i> story on the tragedy </a> from July 20, 1873 even cast doubt on the merit of such endeavors: “Whether it is worth while to risk the lives of brave men in following what may be but a fleeting mirage, is a question which the death of Capt. Hall and the sufferings of his gallant companions will incline most people to answer in the negative.”

These expeditions and the narratives that glorified them demonstrate a shifting rationale for Arctic exploration. In many ways, Bradford’s photographic journey ran parallel to the far-reaching surveys of the American West organized by the U.S. government in the 1860s and 70s. Balancing broad, geographic views with illustrative points of interest, photographers like Timothy O’Sullivan developed a distinctive pictorial economy with a limited number of prints. Yet Bradford was not exploring U.S. lands, nor was he constrained by the bureaucratic demands levied on his counterparts. The Arctic held a nebulous strategic value, but its mystique on stage of colonial exploration was inestimable.

It was not necessary to discover something of tangible economic value, a shipping route through the Northwest Passage, or rare minerals like cryolite that could be mined for profit; just returning from the Arctic was a heroic accomplishment on its own terms. For instance, Dr. Isaac Israel Hayes had been invited to join Bradford’s expedition thanks to his other Arctic experiences, including Kane’s Grinnell expedition.<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="In addition to surviving the harrowing 1853-55 Second Grinnell Expedition in search of John Franklin, Hayes had also organized a privately funded trip in 1860, becoming one of America’s most accomplished Arctic explorers by 1869.
