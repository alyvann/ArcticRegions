<h1>Julianeshaab: New Views of Race and Identity</h1>

<p>
While Arctic exploration might have seemed like a flight of fancy, however, visitors there often found that remote and icy landscape reflected issues central to American culture and society at the time. To Bradford and his late nineteenth-century readers, for instance, Arctic residents evoked questions about race and identity that related to heated debates across the United States.

As the Panther plied its way north, the artist and his crew caught their first glimpse of human life. The photograph at the beginning of the second chapter, <i>A View of Julianeshaab</i>, or “Julian’s Hope,” shows the protected harbor that had become southern Greenland’s largest settlement. Looking down from a rising hill of scrabbled granite, a group of high-peaked wooden homes nestle in the rocky landscape. These structures marked a significant change. A landscape first characterized by strange and inhospitable forms now revealed pockets of inhabitation.

The timber frame buildings also testified to the influence of continental Europeans in Greenland. As Greenland offered no trees for lumber, such structures depended on imported materials. Above a home along the narrow channel of water at right flies a Danish flag, blurred as it flapped in the wind during the camera’s long exposure. The wavering form of the flag serves as an apt metaphor for national identity at this historical moment. It evokes the contingency of political borders in zones of exploration. Photographs like this thus attest to a constant struggle to visualize clarity and firm edges where none exist.

After centuries of control by Christian kings and missionaries from Scandinavia, Greenland became an official colony of Denmark in 1814. (Denmark granted home rule to Greenland in 1979, and in 2008, Greenlanders voted in favor of the Self-Government Act, which gave even more power to their own government.) Since the early nineteenth century, many Danish workers served terms of service on the island. As some Danes stayed on to make homes and families in Inuit land, the different cultures underwent the complex process of assimilation, mixing genes and ways of life.

This vision of hybridity fueled contemporary scientific debates about the nature of race, the principle beneath nineteenth-century social hierarchies. While the theories Charles Darwin described in books like <i>On the Origin of Species</i> (1859) and <i>Descent of Man</i> (1871) remain the most famous, others were also influential. As early as the 1830s, for instance, the prominent British geologist Charles Lyell had introduced provocative new theories about the age of the earth and the effects of glaciers on human geography.

<p>
While men like Dr. Samuel Morton and the Swiss geologist Louis Agassiz help to popularize the pernicious idea of “race” as inherent differences between peoples and their origins, others theorized that ancient connections between regions--such as the ice bridge that linked Greenland with North America--meant that Inuit and Americans were originally cut from the same cloth. Against this backdrop, Bradford’s photographs of the Kalaallit, the Inuit peoples of western Greenland, were of important scientific and cultural value.
</p>

<p>
The artist was nonetheless a product of his time; his writing expresses a view that the Inuit were fundamentally different from those of European descent. Like most of his readers, he considered European religion and culture to be beneficent, civilizing forces on more “savage peoples.” Bradford, himself a Quaker, highlighted signs of Christianity brought by the Danes. He waxed poetic when “the sun broke suddenly upon our sight through a gorge in the Eastern hills [and] his rays fell on the tower of a modest little church.” <a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Bradford, The Arctic Regions, 16.">[1]</a> That said, he reserved more respect than many of his compatriots did for the Inuit and their ways of life. He noted, for example, how the settlement’s Danish Inspector preferred the sealskin garments of his adoptive home and esteemed the local knowledge their construction represented.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the fascination that Bradford and his crew felt for the people of Julianeshaab was mutual. The artist recalled endless questions about the purpose of his trip, though he did not indicate what their opinion was of an expedition “solely for art.” Bradford also described the indigenous technologies at length, notably their kayaks, the slender seal skin boats that native men used for travel and hunting.

Kayaks had long been a point of interest for Arctic enthusiasts in America and Europe, but had rarely been seen in photographs at the time of this journey. George Simpson McTavish, a Hudson’s Bay Company Trader, had made glass plate negatives of several of these seacraft while stationed at Little Whale River in Quebec in 1865. Two years later, at the World’s Fair in Paris, Denmark sent a number of photographs of Greenlanders, examples of their tools and clothes, and models of these “canoes.” But <i>The Arctic Regions</i>' photographs were some of the earliest to show people in their home environment, rather than spectacles in an exhibition. These images showed local families posing for the camera, or a husband and his wife riding a kayak together. Another image captures the twinned image of a man and his craft, the slice of its taught hull reflected in the slow moving water.

<p>
Admiration for the kayak, particularly for the sophistication and elegance of their construction, demonstrated a western respect for indigenous material culture and its enduring usefulness in the sub-arctic environment. Images like these thus may have helped to upend commonly-held views of “Esquimaux” as a primitive and thus inferior race.
