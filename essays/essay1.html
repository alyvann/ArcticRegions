<h1>Continuous Narrative: Tracing an Arctic Journey</h1>

<p>
This essay considers how photographs created a continuous narrative in The Arctic Regions, one that depended on a fluid experience of Arctic space. As you scroll through this essay, the path of the Panther (the expedition’s sail- and steam-powered whaling ship) emerges on the map at left. A red line traces the whole extent of the voyage, from the first landfall in Greenland to the return south to Newfoundland and then to Boston. Tracing the complete path of the journey in this way provides overall geographic context to the project. Specific portions of the expedition appear in greater detail in each subsequent essay.

By representing Arctic space, artists like Bradford were fulfilling broad cultural desires. During the nineteenth century, the United States developed a fascination--for many it became an obsession--with the Arctic. Until the 1800s venturing into those frigid waters had been a rare exploit. But after the Napoleonic Wars, the Arctic reemerged as the great frontier of colonial exploration. New expeditions were planned and underwritten. Men made their names on a single exploit in “The Frozen North.” Their tales of heroism, not to mention tragedy, littered newspapers and periodicals of the day. Lecture halls overflowed when someone spoke on new geographical discoveries in the polar regions. By the middle of the century, Arctic narratives were the most popular type of book in American homes after the Bible.<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Edmund Blair Bolles, The Ice Finders: How a Poet, a Professor, and a Politician Discovered the Ice Age (Washington, DC: Counterpoint, 1999), 228. When Kane returned triumphantly but physically weakened from the Second Grinnell Expedition he led to find Franklin in 1855, he won praise and medals from American Geographical Society.

New technologies of representation, like photography and daily newspapers, further kindled this growing interest by spreading Arctic images through popular visual culture. Those images and reports helped to fill a vacuum of knowledge about Arctic space; despite centuries of naval exploration, much of the top of the world remained uncharted in the early nineteenth century. A map of the “Northern Regions” (shown above) fairly represents the limits of Arctic geography at the time. Part of an 1855 atlas by the renowned New York mapmaker Joseph Hutchins Colton, it portrays Greenland’s coastline as a contour bristling with slender fjords and jagged islands. Yet the space at its northern extent fades to white. While claiming to represent the Arctic, then, the map still conceded that it remained a terra incognita, a land unknown, further obscured by the shifting ice that covered land and sea in the region.
</p>

<p>
Photographs taken in and around this blank space thus proposed a new kind of geographic knowledge. Rather than attempting to fill in Greenland’s vast interior ice sheet with detail, images in The Arctic Reginos traced the contours of the space in a modern medium. Under Bradford’s supervision, the photographers Dunmore and Critcherson produced scores of images. A prestigious London publisher combined 140 of these images with a narrative text by Bradford. When completed, the book offered an aesthetic experience flowed evocatively between word and image, like a ship passing by icebergs on its course. Thus the photographs were positioned as more than just records of places, people and objects; they were discrete views and moments that combined into a continuous experience of space over time. It is also interesting that three general locales--Melville Bay, Karsut (Kangerlussuaq) Fjord the settlement at Qaqortoq--account for a disproportionate share of the images. The view of Western Greenland thus swells in these places, while shrinking in others.

<p>
A quantitative analysis of the photographs reveals trends that reinforce the book’s rhetorical structure. For 60 of these views (42.5 percent of the photographs), some manifestation of the icy landscape--glaciers, icebergs, the ice pack, mountains, fjords--is the main subject of the image. In 29 photographs (20.5%), the composition focuses on human subjects and their ways of life, effectively cropping out the landscape. The remaining 52 images (nearly 37%) frame human life within the Arctic environment, harmonious at times, discordant at others.
</p>

<p>
While this ratio of images decisively constructs the Arctic as vast, unpopulated space, it still over-represents the inhabited portions. For instance, Bradford’s expedition visited only seven distinct settlements over thousands of miles of coastline. Presenting humanity and landscape in this proportion is, of course, intentional, and it accomplishes several things. First, it builds a continuous narrative around human stories, thereby giving rhythm to a space that risked becoming a dizzying succession of icebergs and glaciers. Second, it fulfills the standard ideological narrative of nineteenth-century exploration, proposing that despite the harsh expanse of the Arctic environment, humanity soldiers on.
</p>

<p>
The photographs are also distributed across fifteen chapters so as to create three distinct sections in the book’s narrative arc. The images first make a world, then establish steady progress, and finally swell into climax and resolution.<a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="There are no photographs in the first chapter, which is a history of ancient Greenland written by the historian Da Costa. The final chapter features five photographs but they function more as a reflective coda than as a part of the narrative. The final essay of this project explores those images.">[2]</a> Chapters II-V collectively feature 43 images, 25 of which depict glaciers and icebergs. This density of imagery constitutes the “world making” portion of the narrative, in which icy shapes and indigenous portraits combine to form the contours of a fantastic world never before captured in photographs. Forty images appear, for the most part evenly spaced, across chapters VI-XI, creating a sense of “steady progress” past mile upon mile of repetitive coastline. The book then reaches its narrative and visual climax in chapters XII-XIV, in which 48 photographs record spectacular episodes: a polar bear hunt, three days when the ship was trapped in the ice, and meetings with Danish and Inuit peoples in Greenland’s northern settlements.
</p>

<p>
Scrutinizing the accuracy of the photographs--that is, asking “can we confirm they represent the places they claim to?”--yielded important insights that helped to guide this project. No specific locational data, such as recognizable rock formations, named settlements, or captions with geographic information, can be connected to 22 of the images. Many of them simply depict icebergs adrift in the ocean, like specimens in a nebulous museum.
</p>

<p>
The remaining 118 images fall into four levels of accuracy: none, vague, broad, and exact. To 22, we can attribute no accuracy at all. The iceberg in an image may correspond to the stretch of coastline mentioned in the text, but there is no supporting evidence to confirm it. A vague degree of accuracy applies to 47 pictures, meaning the picture is from a large but imprecise geographic area. To apply this “vague accuracy” criterion, I adopted a syllogistic pictorial logic. For instance, if a distinctive iceberg in one photograph appears in another, and that photograph also depicts an identified mountain peak or headland, then the images can be “vaguely” connected in space.

<p>
A similar approach accounts for the category of broad accuracy, which applies to 54 images. In this context, broad accuracy denotes an image that falls within a small geographic area but imprecisely. A good example of this are photographs of Inuit life taken in or around a specific settlement but lacking verifiable buildings or sites in the frame. While we can be fairly certain of where such images were made, other photographs offer a higher degree of confidence in their location. This final accuracy group can be called exact. In such photographs an obvious topographic landmark, like the monolith known as Devil’s Thumb, indicates a specific location.
</p>

<p>
Plotting the density of these images and their relative accuracy across the book's chapters also reveals important editorial decisions. For instance, chapters 2 and 8 both feature the greatest nummber of images with no accuracy. This may reflect difficulties in taking images at that point of the expedition, or that the chapters in which they appear leaned toward narrative rather than documentation. Similarly, the uptick in images towards the end of the book may betray an inability to find the right words to describe events or phenomena; the artist and publishers seem to have preferred to let the photographs speak more for themselves as things drew to a close.
</p>

<p>
While this quantitative view of the images was fruitful, the results did not lend themselves to normal cartographic modes. The varying degrees of accuracy made the attempt to pinpoint all the photographs on a map--a logical approach to digital mapping projects--highly problematic. What symbols would clearly indicate exact, broad and vague levels of accuracy? How to account for those images lacking geographic information? And how could all these categories be layered in a way that revealed new insights about the photographs and the expedition?
</p>

<p>
Although this analysis did inform new observations in the following essays, the challenge of synthesizing the spatial information in these photographs led toward a different interpretive path. Rather than hinging on the location of specific images, The Arctic Regions works by concatenation, building a narrative through photographic connections in space. It aims to create an experience that flows despite many ambiguous points.
</p>

<p>For these reasons, this project dispensed with the approach of placing points on map and instead attempts to represent the 1869 journey in a fluid, continuous way. Rather than fixate on the location of individual images, “Tracing The Arctic Regions” gives a new level of accuracy to the trajectory of Bradford’s expedition. By doing so, it reveals not only the most photographed zones of the journey but also those that were passed quickly and without documentation.
</p>

<p>In that sense, the project takes a cue from the idea of “tracing.” The word “trace” connotes genealogy or continuum, a line leading from one thing to another, but it also signifies, from the Latin root tractus, an area of indefinite extent. In other words, “tracing” means both connecting the dots but also acknowledging blind spots. While putting a finer point on the path of this historic expedition, this mapping project also acknowledges the ambiguity of certain images. With this dichotomy in mind, we can now move forward to make landfall in Greenland.
