<h1>Historical Background: America and the Arctic</h1>

<p>
During the nineteenth century, the United States developed a special fascination - for many people it became an obsession - with the Arctic. Books by Arctic explorers lay on coffee tables around the country. Lecture halls overflowed when someone spoke on new geographical discoveries in the polar regions. Tales of heroism, not to mention tragedy, in “The Frozen North” littered newspapers and periodicals of the day. 
</p>

<p>
Interest bubbled not despite the fact the Arctic remained largely unexplored; it was this very vacuum of knowledge, the call of the unknown, that made it irresistible. The map of “Northern Regions” shown above, part of an 1855 atlas by the renowned New York mapmaker Joseph Hutchins Colton, fairly represents the extent of known Arctic geography in the United States at the time. Beyond Greenland’s coastline, a contour bristling with slender fjords and jagged islands, shows a terra incognita, a land unknown, further obscured by the shifting ice that covered land and sea in the region.
</p>

<p>
The fantasies projected onto this unknown space brought out two sides of American society. The Arctic stoked excitement as a place to go beyond one’s limits, to dream of new discoveries. But it was also a place for white men to further assert their dominance over women and peoples of different ethnicities. The idea of a ‘barren’ landscape “literalized the colonial fantasy of a tabula rasa where people, history, and culture vanish.”<sup>1</sup> These issues became even more central to American identity in 1867 when the U.S. purchased the Alaska Territory from Russia. Half a million a million square miles of remote northern lands, including a considerable area above the Arctic Circle, became part of the United States. Unsatisfied by even this windfall, certain U.S. government officials starting plotting to purchase Greenland from Denmark, which had colonized the island since the eighteenth century.<sup>2</sup>  
</p>

<p>
While that plan was abandoned, it demonstrated America’s persistent draw towards the Arctic. Discoveries suggested Greenland was more connected to America, both geologically and culturally, than previously believed. Public intrigue reflected the imperial aspirations of the U.S. government. Between 1867 and 1880, America would claim geopolitical control over half of all Arctic space. As the Arctic grew in American consciousness, curiosities multiplied: What was life like up there amidst the ice? What resources lay hidden beneath it? And where did it end? The line blurred between the wish to see what the Arctic looked like and what visions of it could teach Americans about themselves. 
</p>

<p>
It was in this climate that Bradford, who had taken up painting as a second career, became a noted authority on the Arctic. Six trips to Arctic waters during the 1860s made Bradford more than just an intrepid, itinerant artist; he became a recognized authority on Arctic geography. A member of the American Geographical Society, he served as an advisor to the official U.S. Arctic Expedition of 1879-81 on the ill-fated USS Jeannette. He developed this reputation not just by observing and writing about Arctic space as others had done before him, but by representing it with images. 
</p>

<p>
After several smaller trips to Labrador throughout the 1860s, Bradford hired John Dunmore and George Critcherson to be the official photographers on his 1869 exhibition. With financial backing from the New York financier Le Grand Lockwood, a patron of the well-known painter of the West, Albert Bierstadt, Bradford had secured a 350-ton whaling bark christened the Panther, an experienced crew from Newfoundland, and supplies for Dunmore and Critcherson to made scores of glass-plate photographic negatives.
</p>

<p>
Photography, like other new forms of mass-media in the nineteenth century, further stoked public interest. Bradford himself delivered lectures with lantern slide projections, and made large paintings inspired by the immersive format of the “panorama,” a wide-angle kind of representation that created the sense of being surrounded by an environment or historical scene. In other words, photographs in <i>The Arctic Regions</i> hastened the transformation of the Arctic from a space of projected fantasies and incomplete maps into a visible place, full of ice, animals, and people. Bradford’s photographs and paintings of the subject, coveted by titans of industry like Leland Stanford and European aristocracy including Queen Victoria of England, aimed to convey an experience of the Arctic, rather than just to define its borders.
</p>

<p>
Under Bradford’s supervision, Dunmore and Critcherson produced scores of images, under Bradford’s artistic supervision, of Greenland’s western coast from July until October 1869. The 1873 printing of The Arctic Regions in London combined 141 of these images with a narrative text by Bradford, creating a reading experience that flowed between word and image. 
</p>

<p>
While the ambiguous locations of floating icebergs and grinding glaciers make many of the photographs impossible to locate, many images of specific places and people - including many portraits of the Kalaallit, the native Greenland Inuit - offer vivid representations of the Arctic. This spatial art history project identifies the locations of the most striking and important of these images. Following the course of the Panther through Bradford’s text and Dunmore and Critcherson’s photographs, we can “trace” the path of The Arctic Regions and learn why the Arctic and its ice were so important to American culture in the nineteenth-century. 
</p>

<p>
This idea of “tracing” that inspires the project resonates in the book’s most striking omission. Although Bradford would include maps of his journey in lantern slide illustrated lectures in the later 1870s, The Arctic Regions itself contains no map, a sine qua non of standardized spatial representation. This oscillation between cartographic and photographic representations suggests something particular about the Arctic landscape, a quality of spatial specificity that is often ignored in generic discussions of “landscape painting” in art history. In an age when everything seems concretely mapped from above, the Arctic continues to evade our efforts to pin it down.<sup>3</sup> 
</p>

<p>
The slipperiness of this knowledge, of course, comes down to the radical changes of the ice that defines the Arctic. The ability of ice to both obscure and reshape land on a geologic scale is a central part of the aesthetics of ice that we have inherited from this period of nineteenth-century exploration. For this reason, in the following essays “tracing” does not mean confidently bounding something within a certain contour, just as one would not claim that a photographic trace is the same as the thing itself. Instead, they point to a truth that the Arctic helps to illuminate: that the only constant is change.

<sup>2</sup> In this book The Future History of the Arctic, Charles Emmerson cites a 1868 report filed by the mining engineer Benjamin Pierce. It identified Greenland and Iceland as promising areas for U.S. expansion, based on stores of extractable resources, cryolite in Greenland and aluminum in Iceland. The plan particularly would have interested then Secretary of State, William Seward, who had arranged arranged the Alaska Purchase the previous year. Seward left office too early to implement the plan, though given the blowback he received for price of the territory - until the discovery of gold in the Yukon and Klondike at the end of the nineteenth century, Alaska was colloquially called “Seward’s Folly” and “Seward’s Icebox” - he may not have been able or interested to pursue it.
