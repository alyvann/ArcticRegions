<h1>Kakortok: Foundations of Ancient History</h1>

<p>
Greenland's landscape also had signs of ancient non-Inuit society, making its history an especially complicated one for nineteenth-century viewers to understand. At Kakortok, a fjord-flanked strip of land close to Julianeshaab, Bradford and his crew explored the renowned ruins of Hvalsey church. Dating to the medieval Viking period, this stone structure invited Bradford to tie his own exploration narrative to an ancient European past.
</p>

<p>
Old Norse Sagas written mostly in Icelandic had recorded the first European settlements in Greenland, beginning with the arrival of the Norwegian King Erik the Red around 1000 CE. The first chapter of <i>The Arctic Regions</i>, written not by Bradford but by the historian Benjamin Franklin Da Costa, describes this ancient European presence in Greenland.
</p>

<p>
Modern archaeological evidence has revealed more details about the general history that Da Costa outlined. Erik's wife Thorhild had converted to Christianity just before he arrived on the shores of Greenland in 983, setting in motion missionary work that would unfold for centuries to come. Erik’s colony would build several structures which anchored a larger farmstead at Kakortok, culminating in the construction of Hvalsey Church at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The site thereby marks a tumultuous intersection of Norse, Christian, and Inuit cultures and beliefs.<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="For more details on the Norse cultural legacy in Greenland, see Kirsten Seaver, The Frozen Echo: Greenland and the Exploration of North America, ca. A.D. 1000-1500 (Stanford, Ca.: Stanford University Press, 1996), 151-155.">[1]</a>

The church building itself, about 50 feet long and 25 wide, would have held around 30 people. Made from granite fieldstones, the structure rises from rock-littered landscape that surrounds it. The building’s flat face, precisely edged corners, and arched doorway on the anterior gable show the care that went into its construction. It both fits with its location and stands out from it.

<p>
This festal hall, in a rare state of preservation, hosted a number of notable events over the centuries but the Norse chapter ends there at the beginning of the fifthteenth century. In the first weeks of September 1408, Thorstein Olafsson, heir to the Hvalsey farm, married Sigrid Björnsdóttir, daughter of a rich Icelandic family, at the church. The weather on September 17, 1869, seemed to help Bradford feel something of the festive mood that had transpired at the place centuries before: “The weather was delightful. Not a breath of wind disturbed the surface of the water, scarcely a cloud was visible in the sky…It was a day solely for enjoyment, and we made the most of it.”<a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="Bradford, The Arctic Regions, 23.">[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
Bradford did not refer to the place as Hvalsey, a Norwegian word meaning “Whale Island,” but rather as Kakortok, a variant spelling of Qaqortoq, the modern Inuit name for Julianeshaab. While Norse ruins may have been a reminder of “ancient Greenland” for Bradford and his crew, Qaqortok boasted a far longer history. Signs of inhabitation there go back more than four millennia and span several distinct Arctic cultures, from Saqqaq (2500 BCE - 800 BCE) to Dorset (500 BCE–1500 CE) to Thule (200 BCE - 1600 CE).
</p>

<p>
This last group of peoples, who arrived in Greenland around the same time as the Norse, were the ancestors of modern Inuit cultures. Bradford’s choice to identify the site by its Inuit name, therefore, set up a striking contrast between an image that focuses on European legacies and a word that pointed to its current Inuit heritage.
</p>

<p>
This rich and complicated intersection of cultures also registers in the broader visual structure of The Arctic Regions. As the statistical analysis in the first essay revealed, the Qaqortoq region was the third most photographed area of the expedition. Due to both historical significance and current accessibility, Bradford and his crew amply explored neighboring fjords and islands. The specific path of this part of the journey is represented with greater precision in the animation below, with Kakortok being the easternmost point reached.
