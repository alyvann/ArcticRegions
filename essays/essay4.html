<h1>Kakortok: Foundations of Ancient History</h1>

<p>
Greenland's landscape also had signs of ancient non-Inuit society, making its history an especially complicated one for nineteenth-century viewers to understand. At Kakortok (today Qaqortoq), a fjord-flanked strip of land close to Julianeshaab, Bradford and his crew explored the renowned ruins of Hvalsey church. Dating to the medieval Viking period, this stone structure invited Bradford to tie his own exploration narrative to an ancient European past.

<p>
Old Norse Sagas written mostly in Icelandic had recorded the first European settlements in Greenland, beginning with the arrival of the Norwegian King Erik the Red around 1000 CE. The first chapter of <i>The Arctic Regions</i>, written not by Bradford but by the historian Benjamin Franklin Da Costa, describes this ancient European presence in Greenland.

Archeological evidence has shown that the church was part of a larger farmstead built at the beginning of the fourteenth century, though several structures had been previously been built on the site. But when Erik's wife Thorhild converted to Christianity around the time of their arrival in Greenland, she set in motion the missionary work that would unfold for centuries to come. The site of Kakortok thereby marks a tumultuous intersection of Norse, Christian, and Inuit systems of belief.

The church building itself, about 50 feet long and 25 wide, would have held around 30 people. Made from granite fieldstones, the structure rises from rock-littered landscape that surrounds it. The building’s flat face, precisely edged corners, and arched doorway on the anterior gable show the care that went into its construction. It both fits with its location and stands out from it.

A number of events had been recorded in this exceptionally-preserved festal hall. In the first weeks of September 1408 the wedding of Thorstein Olafsson, heir to the Hvalsey farm, and Sigrid Björnsdóttir, daughter of a rich Icelandic family, took place there, marking the end Norse records in Greenland. The weather on September 17, 1869, helped Bradford to feel something of the festive mood that had transpired at the place centuries before: “The weather was delightful. Not a breath of wind disturbed the surface of the water, scarcely a cloud was visible in the sky…It was a day solely for enjoyment, and we made the most of it.” <a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Bradford, The Arctic Regions, 23">[1]</a>
