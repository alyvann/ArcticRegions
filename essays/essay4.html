<h1>Haunts of an Ancient Past: Kakortok</h1>

<p>
Greenland's landscape also had signs of ancient non-Inuit society, making its history an especially complicated one for nineteenth-century viewers to understand. At Kakortoq, a fjord-flanked strip of land close to Julianeshaab, stood the ruins of Hvalsey church. This was the best preserved stone building in the area known as the Eastern Settlement from the medieval Viking period, and thus a major a point of interest for Bradford and his crew.

Old Norse Sagas, written mostly in Icelandic, had record the first European settlements in Greenland, beginning with the arrival of the Norwegian King Erik the Red around 1000AD. The first chapter of The Arctic Regions, written not by Bradford but by the historian Benjamin Franklin Da Costa, describes this ancient history of European presence in Greenland. Archeological evidence has shown that the church was part of a larger farmstead built at the beginning of the fourteenth century, though several structures had been previously been built on the site. But when Erik's wife Thorhild converted to Christianity around the time of their arrival in Greenland, she set in motion the missionary work that would unfold for centuries to come. The site of Kakortok thereby marks an essential intersection between Norse, Christian, and Inuit systems of belief.

The church building itself, about 50 feet long and 25 wide, would have held around 30 people. Made from granite fieldstones, the structure rises naturally from rock-littered landscape that surrounds it. That said, its architecture is highly refined. The building’s flat face, precisely edged corners, and arched doorway on the anterior gable show the care that went into its construction. It both fits with its location and stands out from it prominently, a reminder of how the harsh but indifferent environment both enabled and challenged efforts to survive within it.

As the best-preserved festal hall in all the Nordic countries, the site had been host to a number of notable historical events. In the first weeks of September 1408 the wedding of Thorstein Olafsson, heir to the Hvalsey farm, and Sigrid Björnsdóttir, daughter of a rich Icelandic family, took place there, an event that represents the last written record of Norse society in Greenland. The weather on September 17, 1869, helped Bradford to feel something of the festive mood that had transpired at the place centuries before: “The weather was delightful. Not a breath of wind disturbed the surface of the water, scarcely a cloud was visible in the sky…It was a day solely for enjoyment, and we made the most of it.”

Bradford did not refer to the place as Hvalsey, a Norwegian word meaning “Whale Island,” but rather as “Krakortok,” a variant spelling of Qaqortok, the modern Inuit name for Julianeshaab. While Norse ruins may have been a reminder of “ancient Greenland” for Bradford and his crew, Qaqortok boasted a far longer history. Signs of inhabitation there go back more than four millennia and span several distinct Arctic cultures, from Saqqaq (2500 BCE - 800 BCE) to Dorset (500 BCE–1500 CE) to Thule (200 BCE - 1600 CE). This last group of peoples, who arrived in Greenland around the same time as the Norse, were the ancestors of all modern Inuit cultures. This deep history remained hidden to Bradford and his contemporaries as they pushed deeper towards Arctic territory. The photograph celebrates a deep European history with the land oblivious to longer native histories as well as to the environmental conditions that governed them all.
