<h1>Out of the Fog: Cape Desolation</h1>

<p>
The narrative of The Arctic Regions unfolds chronologically in the summer of 1869. After an introductory chapter on ancient Greenland borrowed from Benjamin Franklin De Costa’s 1868 book, Pre-Colombian Discovery of America by the Northmen, Bradford begins his description on July 3, 1869, when the steamship Panther left the harbor of St. John’s, Newfoundland. The United States flag was flying on the fore topgallant mast; though undertaken “solely for the purposes of art,” as Bradford noted in the introduction, this expedition was also self-consciously nationalistic.

When the fog broke on July 9, the crew sighted its first view of Greenland. An imposing chunk of rock known since 1585 known as Cape Desolation emerged on the horizon. Small icebergs with evocative shaped swirled around the headland. These were the forms that had drawn Bradford to the Arctic in the first place. On previous expeditions to Labrador, he was enraptured by the close study of icebergs around fishing boats. Quick sketches the angles and contours of ice became the basis for paintings that had made him a respected artist.

Labrador Fishing Boats near Cape Charles (1862) is a good example of this period of his work. It marks a significant change from the ship’s portraits that he made early in his career in New Bedford. Labrador Fishing Boats pushes ships from the center of the image to the side, making room for a pointed iceberg at center stage. Here human labor coexists peacefully with natural forces, but the former gives the latter a wide berth.

The photograph of Cape Desolation makes this displacement more extreme. Bradford’s description of the first encounter with Greenland’s coast conjures a more mysterious geography. Sweeping fog pulls the coastline in and out of visibility, while icebergs appear suddenly and dangerously close to the ship. Thus Bradford began his attempt to walk a fine line. Whereas other Arctic explorers from the time framed their expeditions as struggles to survive, images like this lean upon the aesthetic merits of the landscape. The Arctic, in other words, was dangerous but could also be a place of contemplation.

The photographs and related paintings testify to the shifting regard for the Arctic over the course of several decades. While excitement in polar expedition had reached a fever pitch after Kane’s publication of Arctic Explorations in 1855, public perception had shifted a great deal by 1869. Interest in the Arctic evaporated after the outbreak of the Civil War. Many trips north were still in search of Sir John Franklin’s expedition, lost since 1845. As Americans began to hear of men dying for important causes at the battles of Harper’s Ferry and Bull Run, stories of self-elected hardship in the Arctic seemed foolish and wasteful.<sup>4</sup>

With stories of the war and the difficulties of Reconstruction still at hand in 1869, Bradford’s text for The Arctic Regions was shrewd not to associate the Arctic with the language of battle or suffering. In fact, this first encounter with icebergs around Cape Desolation establishes them as surprisingly ambivalent figures. When a stiff wind made it too dangerous to anchor by the coast, the crew decided to make fast to an iceberg for safe harbor. Unlike the Titanic’s fatal collision in 1912, the Panther and an iceberg dovetailed peacefully. Their trajectories were intertwined, however briefly.
