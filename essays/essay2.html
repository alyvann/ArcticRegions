<h1>Cape Desolation: The Art of Conquest</h1>

<p>
The narrative of The Arctic Regions unfolds chronologically in the summer of 1869, from July to October. Yet while book’s photographs attest to particular places and times, Bradford’s text also treated images as a basis for forging other connections. Specifically, his narrative attempted the delicate task of relating his art expedition to some historical precedents while avoiding other more fraught connections.
</p>

<p>
The book’s beginning offers a case in point. After a brief introduction in which Bradford describes his motivations, the text jumps back in time. The first chapter is a historical essay on ancient Greenland, describing the arrival of Norsemen on the island around 1000 CE.<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="The essay was written by the historian Benjamin Franklin De Costa whose 1868 book, Pre-Colombian Discovery of America by the Northmen, describes this period in great detail.">[1]</a> The text thus aligns Bradford himself with the hardy Europeans who had settled the region centuries earlier; the artist is a modern-day Viking in this framework, conquering the bleak landscape not with sword and shield but with pencil, brush and camera.
</p>

<p>
When Bradford begins his narrative on July 3, 1869, the language of conquest takes new form. As the steamship Panther left the harbor of St. John’s, Newfoundland, the American flag flew on the fore topgallant mast of the ship, making clear that while the expedition was “solely for the purposes of art,” U.S. national interests were also aboard. Fantasies projected onto Arctic space brought out two sides of American society. On one hand, the Arctic offered a place to go beyond personal limits and make new discoveries. But on the other, it was a place for Euro-American men to further assert their dominance over other regions of the world at the expense of other identities. Native peoples were often regarded as savages, while capable white women like Lady Jane Franklin were left at home to pine for their departed husbands. The Arctic was presented as a cartographic void that only the fittest men could fill. In the words of the scholar Lisa Bloom, the so-called ‘barren’ Arctic landscape “literalized the colonial fantasy of a tabula rasa where people, history, and culture vanish.”<a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="Lisa Bloom, Gender on Ice: American Ideologies of Polar Expeditions (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993), 2. Bloom opens her introduction by remarking on the “passion for blankness” that animates the character of Marlow in Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (1899)">[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
These fantasies became even more central to American identity in 1867 when the U.S. purchased the Alaska Territory from Russia. Half a million a million square miles of remote northern lands, including a considerable area above the Arctic Circle, became part of the United States. Certain government officials also proposed to buy Greenland from Denmark, which had colonized the island since the eighteenth century through missionary work.<a href="#note3" id="ref2" title="In this book The Future History of the Arctic, Charles Emmerson cites a 1868 report filed by the mining engineer Benjamin Pierce. It identified Greenland and Iceland as promising areas for U.S. expansion, based on stores of extractable resources, cryolite in Greenland and aluminum in Iceland. The plan particularly would have interested then Secretary of State, William Seward, who had arranged arranged the Alaska Purchase the previous year. Seward left office too early to implement the plan, though given the blowback he received for price of the territory - until the discovery of gold in the Yukon and Klondike at the end of the nineteenth century, Alaska was colloquially called “Seward’s Folly” and “Seward’s Icebox” - he may not have been able or interested to pursue it.

</p>

<p>
While that plan was abandoned, it demonstrated the Arctic’s pull on the American colonial imagination. New geological and anthropological discoveries suggested Greenland shared a tighter bond with America than scientists had imagined. Public intrigue reflected the imperial aspirations of the U.S. government. By 1880, the United States would claim more than half of all Arctic space as its own. As the Arctic grew on American maps, curiosities multiplied: What was life like up there amidst the ice? What resources lay hidden beneath it? And where did it end? Exploration promised to show what the Arctic looked like and what visions of it suggested for America’s past and future.
</p>

<p>
It was in this climate that Bradford, who had taken up painting as a second career, had discovered his lifelong fascination with the Arctic. The Icebergs, an ambitious 1861 canvas by the revered landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church, had certainly provided inspiration. Church had based the work on personal encounters with icebergs he made during an 1859 excursion around Labrador (a journey that produced its own published narrative). Bradford followed suit seven times during the 1860s, with expeditions ranging from Labrador to Greenland. These trips made him more than just an intrepid, itinerant artist; he became a recognized authority on Arctic geography. As a member of the American Geographical Society, he served as an advisor to the official U.S. Arctic Expedition of 1879-81 on the (ill-fated) USS Jeannette. He developed this reputation not just by observing and writing about Arctic space as others had done before him, but by linking his brightly-colored paintings with photographs and the weight of truth they were thought to carry.
</p>

<p>
After several smaller trips throughout the 1860s, Bradford hired John Dunmore and George Critcherson as official photographers for the 1869 exhibition. With financial backing from the New York financier Le Grand Lockwood, a patron of the well-known painter Albert Bierstadt, Bradford had secured a 350-ton whaling bark christened the Panther, an experienced crew from Newfoundland, and supplies for Dunmore and Critcherson to made scores of glass-plate photographic negatives.
</p>

<p>
Photography, like other new forms of mass-media in the nineteenth century, further stoked public interest. Bradford himself delivered lectures with lantern slide projections, and made large paintings inspired by the immersive format of the “panorama,” a wide-angle kind of representation that created the sense of being surrounded by an environment or historical scene. In other words, photographs in The Arctic Regions hastened the transformation of the Arctic from a space of projected fantasies and incomplete maps into a visible place, full of ice, animals, and people. While the artist may not have gone to claim Greenland, he did expand what the art historian Angela Miller has called “the empire of the eye”: a kind of artistic nationalism that attempted to bring the fractious and slippery meanings of the natural world under control.<a href="#note4" id="ref4" title="Angela Miller, The Empire of the Eye: Landscape Representation and American Cultural Politics, 1825-1875 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1993), 288.">[4]</a>

This cultural work is on display in <i>The Arctic Regions</i>, which reflects an expeditionary experience that was nothing if not disjointed. When the fog broke on July 9, the crew sighted its first view of Greenland. An imposing chunk of rock known as Cape Desolation emerged on the horizon. Small icebergs with evocative shapes swirled around the headland. These were the forms that had drawn Bradford to the Arctic in the first place. On previous expeditions to Labrador, he was enraptured by the close study of icebergs around fishing boats. Quick sketches of the icebergs there became the basis for paintings that secured his reputation.
</p>

<p>
Paintings like "Labrador Fishing Boats near Cape Charles" (1862) are illustrative of period of his work. They mark a significant change from the ship’s portraits from his early career in New Bedford. Labrador Fishing Boats pushes ships from the center of the image to the side, making room for a pointed iceberg at center stage. The composition implies that human labor coexists peacefully with natural forces; working ships just need to guard a safe distance.

The photograph of Cape Desolation makes this displacement more extreme. Bradford’s description of the first encounter with Greenland’s coast conjures a mysterious geography. Sweeping fog pulls the coastline in and out of visibility, while icebergs appear suddenly and dangerously close to the ship. This was a fine line to walk. Whereas other Arctic explorers from the time framed these encounters as struggles to survive, Bradford also had to record the aesthetic merits of the landscape. The Arctic, in other words, was dangerous but also a place for contemplation.
</p>

<p>
Bradford’s decision to frame the photographs in this way suggests an awareness to how opinions of the Arctic had shifted over several decades. In 1845, British Admiral Sir John Franklin went on the third and last of his expeditions in search of the Northwest Passage, a fabled shipping route to Asia. When Franklin and his crew did not return, an entire generation of seafarers were inspired to discover his fate. Excitement in American polar expedition reached a fever pitch in 1855, when the explorer Elisha Kent Kane published Arctic Explorations, a harrowing account of his attempt to recover Franklin, his crew and their ships. Exploring the Arctic had become a kind of self-perpetuating phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
By 1869, however, public perception had shifted a great deal. Interest in the Arctic all but evaporated after the outbreak of the Civil War. As Americans began to hear of men dying at the battles of Harper’s Ferry and Bull Run, stories of self-elected hardship in the Arctic seemed foolish and wasteful. There was a war to be fought at home; how selfish to risk your life on an Arctic adventure.<a href="#note5" id="ref5" title="See Michael Robinson’s book, The Coldest Crucible: Arctic Exploration and American Culture (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2015), for a deeper look at the rise and fall of American interest in Arctic exploration.">[5]</a> Moreover, Bradford also had to contend with the legacy of the greatest photographic book to come from his native country: Alexander Gardner’s <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/283195" target="_blank"> <i>Photographic Sketchbook of the War</i></a>, two-volumes of prints documenting the brutal events of the American Civil War. Published in 1865, the Sketchbook transformed public perception of war, conveying its “blank horror” in an unprecedented way. As Gardner’s book gained in popularity, Bradford had to take what helpful formal cues he could from its pages while framing it more as an accord between man and nature than a conflict between men.
</p>

<p>
With stories of the war and the difficulties of Reconstruction still at hand, Bradford notably did not associate the Arctic with battle or suffering. (He did not, however, shy away from the mortal peril of Arctic exploration, a topic explored in a later essay.) To this end, this first encounter with icebergs around Cape Desolation establishes them as surprisingly ambivalent figures. When a stiff wind made it too dangerous to anchor by the coast, the crew decided to make fast to an iceberg for safe harbor. For a moment in time, the Panther and an iceberg struck a delicate truce.
