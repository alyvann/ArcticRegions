<h1>Sermitsialik: The Challenges of Scale</h1>


<p>
While The Arctic Regions stressed the signs of human history in the landscape, conveying the massive scale of Arctic history and nature remained a conundrum. Bradford’s encounter with one staggering glacier exemplified this challenge of representation, showing several attempts to solve the complexity of scale.
</p>

<p>
On July 20th at three o’clock p.m., the Panther pulled anchor from the settlement at Kraksimiut in order to sail for Sermitsialik glacier. Steaming past small islands, the ship entered a fjord to reach the calving face of the glacier, where great chunks of ice broke off and became icebergs. Upon arrival, Bradford and the crew left the ship to explore this immense field of ice first with smaller craft and then by foot.
</p>

<p>
A photograph with the lengthy title <i>A view of the glacier forcing itself down over the land and into the waters of the fiord</i> testifies to the overwhelming size of the icy mass, as if normal descriptive lengths failed to capture it. This inability to comprehend polar ice extends to both space and time; perhaps even more than its size, the age of glaciers like this were virtually unfathomable. Contemporary philosopher Timothy Morton even identifies icebergs as powerful examples of what he calls "hyperobjects," by which he means things that "involve profoundly different temporalities than the human-scale ones we are used to."<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Timothy Morton, Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2013), 104.">[1]</a> Riven with cracks and chasms, the glacier spans the whole frame, almost becoming a background for a pensive human figure in the middle distance. His pose--back to us, hand on hip--echoes the Romantic motif of the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/gene/figure-from-the-back-ruckenfigur" target="_blank"><i>Rückenfigur</i></a>, a staple of the influential German painter Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840).
</p>

<p>
But while the figure (likely Bradford himself, posing for his photographers) may have a metaphysical sense of wonder, it also demonstrates the challenge of conveying scale through the human body. At its core, scale is a basic operation of vision. As a relationship or ratio between things, scale is what allows us to judge the real size of objects in space. Looking through a lens, whether in a camera or our eyes, is fundamentally an operation of scale. In fact, the Western pictorial tradition depends on our ability to understand these scalar shifts. Our innate habit of calibrating scale allows us to hold a small portrait and know that it is a small image of an actual person rather than an actual size image of a tiny person.
</p>

<p>
Today as during the nineteenth century, we perform this cognitive recalibration of images without much difficulty. When, however, an image lacks familiar points of reference our scaling abilities begin to break down. The Arctic landscape provides few such features. A nineteenth-century Arctic explorer from Norway summed up the dilemma: “One sees things under circumstances that give one no idea of the distance, and consequently one has no scale for comparison… Under certain conditions of Arctic light, [there is] nothing to give you a measure of the distance, nothing to furnish a scale to determine size by comparison.”<a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="Quoted in Lucy R. Lippard, “Art within the Arctic Circle,” Hudson Review 22, 4 (Winter 1969–1970): 673.">[2]</a> So how could Bradford convey a sense of the 500-foot-tall, four-mile-long Sermitsialik Glacier. This was important not only for people back home but also for Bradford himself, since the photograph would inform one of the artist’s most ambitious paintings.

Placing an average human body in the landscape was not a perfect solution, but it was one of best options available. The question was how close to the glacier that figure should be. Standing next to it created problems, not to mention safety concerns. Set the camera far enough away to capture the whole glacier and a person would become too small to see. Set it close enough to see the figure and the full extent of the glacier would spill beyond the frame. In the Arctic, distance and size seemed always to slip the grasp of artists. The grand, repetitive and shifting landscape constantly defied efforts to describe.
</p>

<p>
As the art historian Christopher Heuer has argued, representations of Arctic space tend to rely not on clearly scaled maps, but on rupturing scalar relationships altogether.<a href="#note3" id="ref3" title="Christopher Heuer, Arctic Matters in Early America, in Scale (Chicago: University of Chicago Press and Terra Foundation for American Art, 2016), 180-214.">[3]</a> Exploring the Arctic led to strange sensory experiences, often described as a dislocation of your body from time and space. In this context, omitting a map from The Arctic Regions may have been a canny decision; how else to convey a sense of disorientation to a viewing public that had come to expect clear cartography? In an age when societies aimed to map space concretely, the Arctic still evaded efforts to pin it down.<a href="#note4" id="ref4" title="This point has been eloquently made in the catalogue for a 2013 exhibition simply titled Arctic, held at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen.

</p>

<p>
Bradford also elicited a breach--or perhaps a dilation--of the senses in his painting of Sermitsialik, which takes an unconventional, even radical format. The image is stretched to a thin strip of canvas, eliminating the human figure from the photograph to focus on the awesome length of the glacier. Signs of exploration are still there, though; the Panther sits to the right of an iceberg in the darkened right corner of the painting.
</p>

<p>
This ribbon-like image may also have been inspired by one of the most technically impressive images in the whole of The Arctic Regions: a two-page photographic panorama of the same glacier, created by combining two full-plate prints across two facing pages.

<p>
	Yet by stretching the photographic book format to its limit, this view only reaffirms the intractable riddle of representing scale. Attempting to give the viewer an immersive view of the glacier, the joined photographs swing too far in a single dimension. The glacier could credibly be either fifty feet tall or five hundred, an ambivalence that strains human reckoning and objective representation in these landscapes.
