<h1>Sermitsialik: The Challenges of Scale</h1>

<p>
While The Arctic Regions stressed the signs of human history in the landscape, conveying the massive scale of Arctic history and nature remained a conundrum. Bradford’s encounter with one staggering glacier exemplified this challenge of representation, showing several attempts to solve the complexity of scale.
</p>

<p>
On July 20th at three o’clock p.m., the Panther pulled anchor from the settlement at Kraksimiut in order to sail for Sermitsialik glacier. Steaming past small islands, the ship entered a fjord to reach the calving face of the glacier, where great chunks of ice broke off and became icebergs. Upon arrival, Bradford and the crew left the ship to explore this immense field of ice first with smaller craft and then by foot.

A photograph with the lengthy title <i>A view of the glacier forcing itself down over the land and into the waters of the fiord</i> testifies to the glacier’s overwhelming size, as if normal descriptive lengths failed to capture it. Riven with cracks and chasms, the glacier spans the whole frame, almost becoming a background for a pensive human figure in the middle distance. His pose--back to us, hand on hip--echoes the Romantic motif of the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/gene/figure-from-the-back-ruckenfigur" target="_blank"><i>Rückenfigur</i></a>, a staple of the influential German painter Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840).

But while the figure (likely Bradford himself, posing for his photographers) may have a metaphysical sense of wonder, it also demonstrates the challenge of conveying scale. At its core, scale is a basic operation of vision. As a relationship or ratio between things, scale is what allows us to judge the real size of objects in space. Looking through a lens, whether in a camera or our eyes, is fundamentally an operation of scale. In fact, the Western pictorial tradition depends on our ability to understand these scalar shifts. Our innate habit of calibrating scale allows us to hold a small portrait and know that it is a small image of an actual person rather than an actual size image of a tiny person.

<p>
Today as during the nineteenth century, we perform this cognitive recalibration of images without much difficulty. When, however, an image lacks familiar points of reference our scaling abilities begin to break down. The Arctic landscape provides few such features. A nineteenth-century Arctic explorer from Norway summed up the dilemma: “One sees things under circumstances that give one no idea of the distance, and consequently one has no scale for comparison… Under certain conditions of Arctic light, [there is] nothing to give you a measure of the distance, nothing to furnish a scale to determine size by comparison.”<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Quoted in Lucy R. Lippard, “Art within the Arctic Circle,” Hudson Review 22, 4 (Winter 1969–1970): 673.">[1]</a> So how could Bradford convey a sense of the 500-foot-tall, four-mile-long Sermitsialik Glacier. This was important not only for people back home but also for Bradford himself, since the photograph would inform one of the artist’s most ambitious paintings.

	Placing an average human body in the landscape was not a perfect solution, but it was one of best options available. The question was how close to the glacier that figure should be. Standing next to it created problems, not to mention safety concerns. Set the camera far enough away to capture the whole glacier and a person would become too small to see. Set it close enough to see the figure and the full extent of the glacier would spill beyond the frame. In the Arctic, distance and size seemed always to slip the grasp of artists. The grand, repetitive and shifting landscape constantly defied efforts to describe.

As the art historian Christopher Heuer has argued, representations of Arctic space tend to rely not on clearly scaled maps, but on rupturing scalar relationships altogether.<a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="Christopher Heuer, Arctic Matters in Early America, in Scale (Chicago: University of Chicago Press and Terra Foundation for American Art, 2016), 180-214.">[2]</a> Exploring the Arctic led to strange sensory experiences, often described as a dislocation of your body from time and space. In this context, omitting a map from The Arctic Regions may have been a canny decision; how else to convey a sense of disorientation to a viewing public that had come to expect clear cartography? In an age when societies aimed to map space concretely, the Arctic still evaded efforts to pin it down.<a href="#note3" id="ref3" title="This point has been eloquently made in the catalogue for a 2013 exhibition simply titled Arctic, held at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen.

The question of scale nonetheless remained difficult to resolve, as another photograph from Sermitsialik shows. Taken from atop the glacier, it divides its composition diagonally between a a jagged edge of the glacier close to the picture plane and a view of the fjord receding into distance at upper left. As is often the problem with ice at this scale, it is difficult for the viewer to calculate the height of this frozen form in the foreground. It could be six feet tall or sixty, an uncertainty that, while failing perhaps to capture the grandeur of the glacier on the whole, does convey the sense of disorientation that can often befall explorers of glacial landscapes.

It seems that many of the Panther’s crew, in addition to a number of Kalaallit guides from Kraksimiut, may have been there to experience these distortions of scale. Another photograph captures a motley group camped out on the glacier. There are Inuit in traditional dress, clean-shaven white men in formal attire, and bearded sailors taking a drink. The strategic placement of national flags affirms that at least three different nationalities were traveling together in these late July days. The wavering forms of these flags also serve an an apt metaphor for notions of national boundaries and identity at this historical moment. The Danish flag, which flaps towards the camera to the right of the tent at center, is almost indiscernible as such.

While symbolizing the far off government in Copenhagen that held colonial possession of all of Greenland at the time, the flag flutters too much to show all of its white cross. The American flag, for its part, seems even most wraithlike, a transparent triangle of stars and stripes. Though government functionaries had in 1868 drafted plans to purchase Greenland from Denmark, the idea was never close to becoming reality. In fact, that very plan had been devised to pressure the country represented at viewer’s left: the Union Jack of United Kingdom. The Canadian provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, home to most of the expedition’s crew, were represented by this flag, albeit tenuously. In fact, it was in this very year of 1869 that those provinces voted to reject confederation with greater Canada, preferring an quasi-independent government that nonetheless fell under British sovereignty. The rounded and folded shapes of the flags in motion thereby speak to the contingency and imprecision of national borders at this moment. Representing arctic space in photographs like this thus betray a constant struggle to visualize clarity and firm edges where none exist.

  <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> There are no photographs in the first chapter, which is a history of ancient Greenland written by the historian Da Costa. The final chapter features five photographs but they function more as a reflective coda than as a part of the narrative. The final essay of this project explores those images.
