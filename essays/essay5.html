<h1>Ice, Overwhelming: Sermitsialik</h1>

<p>
On July 20th, at three o’clock p.m., the Panther pulled anchor from the settlement at Kraksimiut in order to sail for the immense glacier of Sermitsialik. The only way of reaching it was by steaming through miles of small islands and a fjord to the calving face of the glacier, where great chunks of ice broke off and became icebergs. Staging the Panther at bay, Bradford and the crew then began to explore this immense field of ice with smaller craft and, finally, by foot. A photograph titled “A view of the glacier forcing itself down over the land and into the waters of the fiord” captures a moment of staged contemplation. Riven with ragged, cracked textures, the glacier stripped across the center of the composition nonetheless as background for this pensive human figure on a spit of dead ice in the middle distance. The pose calls to mind the Romantic motif of the Ruckenfigur, famously represented by the German painter Caspar David Friedrich.

But while he does evoke something of the metaphysical, self-questioning quality of a figure in a Romantic landscape, the man also serves in this photograph as a way of recording scale. Bradford had good reason to gauge the size of a human against this 250-foot-tall glacier; it would become the subject of one of his more ambitious paintings inspired by the trip, titled “Sermitsialik Glacier.”

In addition to shifting qualities of light on display in the roiling atmosphere above the glacier, the most notable aspect of this composition is the exaggeration of its format. In order to accommodate the length of the glacier, the canvas was stretched long along its horizontal axis while it was vertically squeezed. It is easy to miss the rendition of the Panther tucked to the right of an iceberg in the darkened right corner of the painting. The result is an uncommon strip, seemingly inspired by one of the most technically impressive images in the whole of The Arctic Regions: a two-page photographic panorama of the same glacier, created by combining two full-plate prints across two facing pages. This two-page spread aimed to take full advantage of photographic medium and book format to give its viewer the most immersive experience possible.

The question of scale nonetheless remained difficult to resolve, as another photograph from Sermitsialik shows. Taken from atop the glacier, it divides its composition diagonally between a a jagged edge of the glacier close to the picture plane and a view of the fjord receding into distance at upper left. As is often the problem with ice at this scale, it is difficult for the viewer to calculate the height of this frozen form in the foreground. It could be six feet tall or sixty, an uncertainty that, while failing perhaps to capture the grandeur of the glacier on the whole, does convey the sense of disorientation that can often befall explorers of glacial landscapes.

It seems that many of the Panther’s crew, in addition to a number of Kalaallit guides from Kraksimiut, may have been there to experience these distortions of scale. Another photograph captures a motley group camped out on the glacier. There are Inuit in traditional dress, clean-shaven white men in formal attire, and bearded sailors taking a drink. The strategic placement of national flags affirms that at least three different nationalities were traveling together in these late July days. The wavering forms of these flags also serve an an apt metaphor for notions of national boundaries and identity at this historical moment. The Danish flag, which flaps towards the camera to the right of the tent at center, is almost indiscernible as such.

While symbolizing the far off government in Copenhagen that held colonial possession of all of Greenland at the time, the flag flutters too much to show all of its white cross. The American flag, for its part, seems even most wraithlike, a transparent triangle of stars and stripes. Though government functionaries had in 1868 drafted plans to purchase Greenland from Denmark, the idea was never close to becoming reality. In fact, that very plan had been devised to pressure the country represented at viewer’s left: the Union Jack of United Kingdom. The Canadian provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, home to most of the expedition’s crew, were represented by this flag, albeit tenuously. In fact, it was in this very year of 1869 that those provinces voted to reject confederation with greater Canada, preferring an quasi-independent government that nonetheless fell under British sovereignty. The rounded and folded shapes of the flags in motion thereby speak to the contingency and imprecision of national borders at this moment. Representing arctic space in photographs like this thus betray a constant struggle to visualize clarity and firm edges where none exist.
