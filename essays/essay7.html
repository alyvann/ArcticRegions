<h1>Devil’s Thumb: Picturing Animal Life and Death</h1>

<p>
Comparing Greenland to American may have helped some readers to imagine themselves in the Arctic, but other views seemed to reinforce the division between normal American life and the polar environment. In particular, a garish encounter with polar bears expresses conflicting attitudes towards animal life and the natural world in nineteenth-century thought.

Sketching along on deck one night, Bradford noted a shift on the ice pack; a group of bears, a mother and two cubs, emerged from white background and continued past the ship. Comparing the adult female to a stealthy cat, and her two cubs to playful, water-loving kittens, Bradford described his hushed reaction to the bears’ “natural movements upon their native ice.” In the ensuing pages, the artist recounted the collective rush “to shoot” the bears with both guns and cameras, a double-entendre popular since the invention of photography. The pursuit reached its bloody resolution in the photograph above, titled “Hunting by Steam in Melville Bay,” in which crew members pose over the lifeless carcasses of the six bears they have shot: a picture as hunting trophy.

This memorable episode occurred near Devil’s Thumb, a pinnacle of rock rising next to the swirling sea ice of Melville Bay, which marked the location of coveted seal-hunting grounds. The thumb rises on the horizon of a photograph in <i>The Arctic Regions</i> as a polar bear, the seals’ natural predator, moves across the ice.

A special fascination for nineteenth-century viewers, the polar bear remains the preeminent natural icon of the Arctic. In fact, the name of the region itself comes from the Greek word <i>Arktikós</i>, the country of the great bear. To the Inuit, Tôrnârssuk, the ice bear, is one of the most important and powerful deities. fPolar eskimos in the area of northwest Greenland, where the hunt in The Arctic Region occurred, call the polar bear <i>pisugtooq</i>, the great wanderer. The name fits; polar bears can travel 200 miles in a day and up to 2000 thousand in the course of a year.

Yet unlike the Inuit, who honored the bear’s intelligence and emulated its hunting practices, Victorians held an antagonistic view of the animals. In a land lacking human adversaries, polar bears became a kind of de facto foe. They had earned an ominous reputation due to their supposed role in the demise of Sir John Franklin. While searching for the expedition’s lost crew in 1859, British naval officer Francis Leopold McClintock discovered a whaleboat from Erebus, one of Franklin’s ships, with human skeletons inside. One of them appeared to have been destroyed by “large and powerful animals.” Death by polar bear was a far more palatable explanation for these dismembered remains than cannibalism amongst the crew. The British artist Edward Landseer created one of the most iconic visions of this supposed polar bear attack in his 1864 painting <i>Man Proposes, God Disposes</i>.

To the left of the composition a bear hunches and furrows its brow like a Rubensian Hercules. It clenches jaws around frayed red cloth and looming over the telescope, compass, and other among the sixty-relics that McClintock had discovered at the site.<a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Russell A Potter, Arctic Spectacles: The Frozen North in Visual Culture, 1818-1875 (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2007), 165–67.">[1]</a> Despite the chilling delight it has in cleaning last scraps from the human rib in its mouth, the bear at right seems endearing by comparison, prettily closing its eyes and flicking its tongue in satisfaction. For blood-thirsty animals, these polar bears were certainly personable.

The decision to depict animals capable of such human expression reflects a changing relationship between human and animal life in nineteenth-century thought. In 1859, Charles Darwin published his watershed text On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, a book asserting that all living things shared a common ancestry. This provocative theory deeply affected many prominent thinkers in America, contributing to discussions about both animal and human rights.<a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="See Randall Fuller, The Book That Changed America : How Darwin's Theory of Evolution Ignited a Nation (New York: Viking, 2017).">[1]</a> The ethical treatment of nature and its creatures became a core principle of growing movements like conservationism, while new scientific disciplines like ecology described the deep interdependency of all living things. In this context, it became difficult to see an individual polar bear, for instance, and not imagine the role it played in the balance of the Arctic environment.

Landseer’s painting may have had more immediate intentions, like addressing public anxiety about allegations of cannibalism amongst Franklin’s marooned crew. (Recent discoveries confirm that the expedition’s starving survivors did in fact resort to eating the remains of their deceased crewmen.<a href="#note3" id="ref3" title="More than a century of research has confirmed what Victorian mores refused to accept. A 1993 Canadian archeological excavation the expedition’s remains found deep cuts on crew members’ bones consistent with cannibalism. Russell A Potter, Finding Franklin: The Untold Story of a 165-Year Search (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2016), 158–59. The landmark 2014 discovery of the Erebus, one of the expedition’s ships, found evidence of pot polish on the bones, a sign that they were boiled by starving survivors for sustenance. See S. Mays and O. Beattie, “Evidence for End-Stage Cannibalism on Sir John Franklin’s Last Expedition to the Arctic, 1845,” International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, January 1, 2015.">[3]</a>) The bears’ natural diet of seal blubber make them unlikely aggressors in the Franklin saga; they are more often the victims of human incursion into their habitat. Though fast, powerful and highly curious, polar bears are generally reclusive, solitary animals. Thus the mother bear and two cubs that Bradford spotted in Melville Bay on a sunlit night in that first week of August, 1869 were more likely avoiding the Panther than investigating it.

While photographs like this certainly held a shocking, even gruesome appeal, Bradford must have noted that they could just as easily offend his viewers as excite them. In his later paintings, Bradford drew further attention to this distinction of natives and visitors that indicates a greater appreciation of Arctic animal life. A glowing Arctic sunset titled <i>Ice Dwellers Watching the Invaders</i> pictures a mother bear and two cubs at lower right, rigidly observing a ship steaming through the ice pack. The canvas therefore presents an interesting inversion of colonial exploration: here, the bears are the natives, and the humans, the foreigners.
