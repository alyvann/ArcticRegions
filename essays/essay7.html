<h1>Blood on the Ice: Devil’s Thumb</h1>

<p>
Memorable vistas like the mouth of a large fjord are more than just points of aesthetic interest; they also frame our understanding of a place and what happens there. With its vast yet repetitive horizon, the Arctic is an often disorienting space. Its almost numbing uniformity, however, can be broken by a prominent feature of the landscape, or of that landscape’s inhabitants. 
</p>

<p>
One such feature is the Devil’s Thumb, a pinnacle of rock on Kullorsuaq Island, which served as a beacon for travelers like Bradford and his crew. By photographing the Thumb, Dunmore and Critcherson tied the path of the Panther to a specific point of land amidst the swirling sea ice of Melville Bay. Devil’s Thumb presided over a portion of ocean that had become a coveted hunting ground for seals; in a wood engraving from 1876, the animals appear so plentiful that they almost bubble out of the icy sea. The same form is rises from the horizon of a photograph in The Arctic Regions as polar bears retreat across the ice.

This connection to a real and recognizable place was important to asserting the credibility of one of the most dramatic episodes in the whole of The Arctic Regions: the polar bear hunt.
</p>

<p>
A special fascination for nineteenth-century viewers, the polar bear remains the preeminent natural icon of the Arctic. In fact, the name of the region itself comes from the Greek word Arktikós, the country of the great bear. To the Inuit, Tôrnârssuk, the ice bear, is one of the most important and powerful deities. fPolar eskimos in the area of northwest Greenland, where the hunt in The Arctic Region occurred, call the polar bear pisugtooq, the great wanderer; they have been known to travel 200 miles in a day and up to 2000 thousand in the course of a year.

In the Victorian imagination, the bears had a decidedly ominous reputation thanks to their supposed role in the demise of Sir John Franklin. While searching for the expedition’s lost crew in 1859, British naval officer Francis Leopold McClintock discovered a whaleboat from Erebus, one of Franklin’s ships, with human skeletons inside. One of them appeared to have been destroyed by “large and powerful animals.” Death by polar bear was a far more palatable explanation for these dismembered remains than cannibalism, which recent discoveries have shown to be part of the Franklin expedition’s story. The British artist Edward Landseer created one of the most iconic visions of this episode in his 1864 painting Man Proposes, God Disposes.

To the left of the composition a bear hunches and furrows its brow like a Rubensian Hercules, clenches jaws around frayed red cloth and looming over the telescope, compass, and other among the sixty-relics that McClintock had actually discovered at the site. Despite the chilling delight it has in cleaning last scraps from the human rib in its mouth, the bear at right seems almost endearing by comparison, prettily closing its eyes and flicking its tongue in satisfaction. Scholars have read this feature as displacing anxiety over allegations of cannibalism amongst Franklin’s marooned crew; bears might have human qualities, but they remained blood-thirsty animals.<sup>5</sup> Reviewers criticized the motives of the work, calling it in poor taste, perhaps because it stirred in them fears of a terrible death.

With a diet based on the seals in Greenland’s northern waters, polar bears would have been unlikely attackers for Franklin. Though fast and powerful, they are a typically retiring animal though their aversion to human contact may be overcome by a noted curiosity. These character traits make it difficult to know whether a mother bear and two cubs were approaching or evading the Panther in Melville Bay on a sunlit night in that first week of August, 1869. In his telling, Bradford was sketching alone on deck when he saw the bears emerge from the white landscape. Comparing the adult female to a stealthy cat, and her two cubs to playful, water-loving kittens, Bradford describes his hushed reaction to the bears’ “natural movements upon their native ice.”

<p>
In his later paintings, Bradford drew further attention to this distinction of natives and visitors. A glowing Arctic sunset titled Ice Dwellers Watching the Intruders (1875) pictures a similar group of bears — a mother and two cubs — at lower right, rigidly observing a bark as it steams through the ice pack. In this equation, Bradford subverts the presumptions of colonial exploration: here, the bears are the natives, and the humans, the foreigners.

While this perspective may suggest a heightened level of respect for the animals and their home, the thrill of the hunt was too much for the crew of the Panther to put aside. In the following pages, Bradford describes the collective rush “to shoot” the bears with both guns and cameras, a double-entendre already popular for the young medium of photography. The pursuit reaches its bloody resolution in a photograph titled “Hunting by Steam in Melville Bay,” in which crew members pose over the lifeless carcasses of the six bears they have shot: a picture as hunting trophy.
