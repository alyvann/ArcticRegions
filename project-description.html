I. Why map an Arctic art expedition?

The inspiration to create a map of William Bradford’s 1869 art expedition to Greenland grew from a curious absence. The Arctic Regions, the ornate 1873 book of photographs that documented the expedition, is full of fascinating images of the Arctic, its landscape and the human and non-human animals that lived there. And yet the book contains no map, the conventional way of visualizing space. This project, Tracing The Arctic Regions, set out to explain that absence and also to fill it with a map that was both interpretive and interactive.

Through 90 pages of text and 141 photographs of the expedition, The Arctic Regions presents no cartographic information about the route of the voyage, even though it’s clear maps and charts would have been essential to the ship’s navigation. It’s possible that Bradford, as an artist, believed that the power of the images from the journey should remain undiluted by other kinds of representation. Perhaps he wanted the photographs to provide a more intimate, poignant experience. We do know, however, that Bradford included maps of Greenland in his slide lectures, recognizing that his audience needed some level of orientation in the distant and strange space of the Arctic.

While photographs represent space as much as they preserve moments in time, it remains difficult if not impossible to link them to points on a map. Creating a more precise map of the expedition thus promised new insights into not just what Greenland looked like in 1869, but also into the geologic and cultural conditions of the places depicted.

Bradford viewed his photographs as groundbreaking depictions of the Arctic. Many of his peers agreed. Besides his written descriptions, the illustrated lectures the artist gave for years after the voyage conveyed a vivid experience of the Frozen North. It was essential that he convey a chill of the real to his audience. While there’s no evidence he retraced the precise route of his voyage, he did begin to include broader maps of the Arctic in his slide collections, presumably to orient his audience and to connect the photographs implicitly to Greenland’s complicated coastline.

Advances in recent scholarship on Bradford and The Arctic Regions provided two important precedents to this mapping project. Both were products of museum exhibitions, one at the Clark Art Institute in 2008 and another at the New Bedford Whaling Museum in 2012, which reconstructed the journey in general terms. This project aims to continue and expand on those efforts. Reading The Arctic Regions closely offers clues about where certain images were made, showing more precisely where Bradford and his crew went and what they saw there.

This digital project serves four main purposes: it gives geographic and historical context to specific photographs; it provides a way of evaluating Bradford’s artistic and editorial process; it generates an integrated and dynamic experience of spatial movement and narrative progress; and it paves the way to compare historical images to present day photographs of the same locations in Greenland to see how the landscape has changed.

II. What does this project reveal about William Bradford and his art?

Bradford’s expedition was a remarkable feat for an American artist. The photographs from 1869 represent the earliest photographic record of Arctic Greenland, covering thousands of miles of coastline. But the expedition also reveals much about the general importance of the Arctic to American art and visual culture. With support from a prominent industrial capitalist and participation of well-known explorers, the expedition further demonstrated the important role artists played in making sense of the Arctic.

Though Bradford appears as a minor character in the history of American art today, he was a popular and respected painter of his age. Rather than focus uniquely on how this book informed Bradford’s successful painting practice, however, this project explores how the book of photographs has come to stand on its own terms as a significant historical and artistic artefact. Retracing Bradford’s historic expedition offers new insights into the real places and peoples he depicted, as well as the points where his account diverged from reality.

Yet while the relationship between nineteenth-century painting and photography factored in this project, it led to broader questions about what counted as true and false in artistic representation. As the visualizations of this project make clear, it became important to go beyond deciding which paintings faithfully copied “true” photographs and which exercised artistic license. By focusing on The Arctic Region’s visual and verbal rhetoric, the analysis and visualizations in this project help to show how and why Bradford constructed the narratives of discovery, self-actualization and creativity that animated The Arctic Regions and the role of the artist in nineteenth-century American culture.

III. What methodologies and design processes guided the work?

This project began like so many digital humanities projects do: as a spreadsheet. By choosing to focus my dissertation for Stanford’s Department of Art & Art History on The Arctic Regions, I had developed a study with unorthodox parameters. For instance, while the book counts as a single object, it can also be treated as various sets of smaller entities to quantify and analyze. I began by searching for all extant copies of the book in library catalogs and museum collections around the world, eventually crowdsourcing a census for the volume. (While the prospectus from publisher Sampson, Low, Marston, Low and Searle set the intended print run at 350, the elevated cost of printing the volume meant that far fewer were produced; at this time, the census identifies only around 40 copies.)

Tallying up the books prompted me to approach the book’s images in a similar way, as a process of accounting for both likeness and difference. As I leafed again and again through photographs of icebergs, Inuit villages and a steamship framed by precipitous fjords, questions about style and substance began to crystallize. Could we be certain about where and when these photographs were made? What was their most common subject matter? And what did the proportions of these subjects say about ideology and rhetoric of the book’s narrative voice?

Given that these questions concerned patterns woven into the photographs, my research turned to related art historical studies for inspiration, including a pioneering work by the renowned historian of art and material culture Jules Prown. In his 2001 book Art as Evidence: Writings on Art and Material Culture, Prown included an essay titled “The Art Historian and the Computer,” in which he encoded works by the painter John Singleton Copley as data. While the steps involved in this statistical analysis stem from a different age--these were still the days of computer punch cards--Prown concluded in this 1964 study that this basic methodology of parsing different kinds of images would be fruitful for other forms of art history.

Yet while Prown’s work did provide important inspiration to this project, Tracing The Arctic Regions predominantly concerned different kind of information, in this case geospatial. While many projects in the digital humanities choose to represent historical phenomena as points on a map, my efforts to plot the locations of all images in The Arctic Regions quickly devolved into uncertainty; a significant proportion of the images offer scant geographical data. Because common geospatial software is built on an empirical model that requires precise coordinates, it became clear that an alternative mapping model would be necessary.

Increasingly I wondered what it would look like to represent the book on its own terms, less as a sequence of discrete views than as a continuous narrative.

V. What lessons does this project offer to work in the digital humanities?

Tracing the Arctic Regions is the result of work spread over years. The project began as a way of helping to interpret the images of primary concern in my dissertation in Stanford’s Department of Art & Art History
